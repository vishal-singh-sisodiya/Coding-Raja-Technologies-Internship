**Movie Recommendation System**

**Overview**

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project leverages data science techniques to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. It uses various algorithms and models to analyze user behavior and movie attributes, providing personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience.

**Features**

Personalized Recommendations: Tailors movie suggestions based on individual user preferences and viewing history.

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user-item interactions to recommend movies that similar users have enjoyed.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies with similar attributes to those the user has liked in the past.

Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.

Scalable: Designed to handle large datasets and deliver recommendations in real-time.

**Technology Stack**

Programming Language: Python, Jupyter Notebook

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Web Framework: PyCharm Community

**Data Sources**

MovieLens: A large dataset containing millions of movie ratings and tag applications from users.

**Usage**

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset. Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature engineering.

Model Training: Train collaborative filtering models using techniques like Matrix Factorization, SVD, or neural networks. Train content-based models using movie attributes and user preferences.

Generating Recommendations: Use the trained models to generate personalized movie recommendations for each user.
